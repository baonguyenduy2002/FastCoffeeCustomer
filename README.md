# FastCoffee

Application is developed based on practical demand to technicalize the purchase process at
take-away coffee points and connect them to make a convenience for customers on purchasing
coffee quickly on their way. The system is built with ideas allowing takeaway coffee shops to
buy an operating license and register to the system and provide their products to the customer.
The customer needs to log in to the system and provide their personal information also their
preferred drink, coffee shop or frequent route, etc that supports their order. The customer can
place an order directly on the system and the coffee shop - a partner can accept or refuse it. The
system will track the customerâ€™s position to notice a partner preparing their drink. The system
will assist in identifying the right user so that the partner can deliver the correct order to the
customer. The system also supports the handling of problems between customers and partners.
The application operates based on the automatic system with tasks to be processed without user interaction. 
The application is built on the foundation of Web applications, Mobile
applications using expo, API, and services to provide independent consumer components...
